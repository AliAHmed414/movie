1
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:06,713
My name is Nikita.

2
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:10,898
6 years ago I was taken out of prison

3
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:14,378
and forced by a covert unit
of the government to be an assassin.

4
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:18,905
3 years ago, I escaped,

5
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:21,241
and have been hunted
ever since.

6
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:25,639
I was the first recruit
to get out.

7
00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:30,617
I'm going to make certain
I'm not the last.

9
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:50,870
Come on!

10
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:01,247
Come on, come on, come on.

11
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:12,358
Aahh!

12
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,689
Stay right there!

13
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:43,361
Don't move!

14
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:52,031
She's just a kid.

15
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:56,302
Taking this one
down to solitary.

16
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:58,805
Watch out... She's a biter.

17
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,014
They're going to love you here.

18
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:11,851
I didn't do it!
I didn't do it!

19
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,859
Evening, Alex.

20
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,780
It is Alex, right?

21
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,482
Never Alexandra.

22
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,250
Who are you?

23
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:49,489
Where am I?

24
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:52,191
Well, you're not
in prison anymore.

25
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,594
You're not even in Michigan,

26
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:56,963
although we're the only
ones that know that.

27
00:02:56,997 --> 00:03:00,066
Your death was officially
ruled a suicide

28
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,847
by the prison coroner
on November first.

29
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:06,272
Your ashes are stored
right here.

30
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,511
My name's Michael.

31
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:13,780
I work for the government.

32
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:16,916
We've decided to give
you a second chance.

33
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:19,485
Why?

34
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:21,187
Why me?

35
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,991
Because you're a young
attractive white female

36
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:28,227
with virtually no personal
ties or paper trail.

37
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:29,729
Now, those do exist,

38
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:31,898
but they're hard to come by.

39
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:34,926
What really grabbed
our attention, though,

40
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:38,870
how you managed to kill a criminal
we were about to take out.

41
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:42,909
Aah! Ow!

42
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:45,608
His name was Kyle, by the way.
He was part of a smuggling ring.

43
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:48,648
Stand and your wrist breaks.
I didn't kill no one!

44
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:50,016
It was Ronnie!

45
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,151
Your boyfriend's body was
found next to his apartment,

46
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:54,554
dead from an overdose.

47
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:56,723
No one showed up
to his funeral, either.

48
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:03,529
Your life is over, Alex.

49
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,333
I'm here to offer you
a new one.

50
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,870
But you have to be
willing to earn it.

51
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,874
What do I gotta do?

52
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,943
Learn.

53
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:19,679
How not to sound like a teen
meth whore, for starters.

54
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:22,849
Learn to stand up straight.

55
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:25,685
Learn how to walk right.

56
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,788
Learn how to talk right.

57
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:33,860
Learn how to serve
your country...

58
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:37,263
Instead of just yourself.

59
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,496
Chica.

60
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:13,633
You.

61
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:18,237
Como te llamas?

62
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:19,739
Nikita.

63
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,841
Nikita.

64
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,786
Never seen you before, Nikita.

65
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,912
Who brought you here?

66
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:28,214
Elena. Yelena?

67
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,916
She said there was
a cool party,

68
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,918
so, uh, here I am.

69
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:37,757
Venga.

70
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:38,825
Come.

71
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:40,159
Have a drink.

72
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,228
I was kinda hoping to stay dry.

73
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,130
Why don't we go to the bar?

74
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,065
As you say,
this is a cool party.

75
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,969
If you want to stay, you're
going to have to get...wet.

76
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:07,053
That wasn't so bad, was it?

77
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:11,090
I would have preferred the bar.

78
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:13,359
It's just that

79
00:06:13,393 --> 00:06:16,162
this is going to make
taking your bodyguard out

80
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:18,664
so much harder.

81
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:20,166
Como?

82
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:35,715
Target is down! I need extraction
at the service entrance.

83
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:36,783
Negative.

84
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:37,984
Extraction impossible.

85
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:39,519
What?

86
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,320
You always had trouble
listening, didn't you?

87
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,689
Michael! Please,
I need to get out of here.

88
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,492
Still don't hear me.
I told you.

89
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,996
There is no out.

90
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,260
Hi, Gary.

91
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:22,762
"Hi, Gary"?

92
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,530
That's a nice touch, honey,

93
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:26,532
but I ain't buying anything.

94
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,034
Ah, all right.

95
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:30,336
Let's try this again.

96
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:36,742
Hi, daddy.

97
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:39,278
Nikita...

98
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:45,751
Wow.

99
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:49,155
You really let this place
go after Caroline died.

100
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:51,757
I guess no more
foster kids like me

101
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:54,260
to clean up your crap, either.

102
00:07:57,364 --> 00:08:00,800
You... you broke
my friggin' wrist! Ah!

103
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:02,268
Sit up, Gary.

104
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:04,670
Try to pay attention, ok?

105
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:07,874
I need to tell you what happened
to me after I ran away.

106
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:10,009
It starts off
like you'd expect,

107
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:11,777
and then it gets
a little weird.

108
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,812
Nikita...

109
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,180
After I ran away,

110
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:15,781
I got with a pretty bad crowd.

111
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:19,085
Did a lot of drugs.

112
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:21,687
Anything that made me
forget about you.

113
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:24,924
Nikita, baby,
that was 10 years ago.

114
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:27,326
It was 11. I'm 27 now.

115
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:29,996
If you call me baby again,
I'll break something else.

116
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,698
They told me I killed a cop.

117
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,534
I don't remember.
I've tried to.

118
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:39,338
I'd just turned 18,

119
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:42,508
so they were able to
charge me with murder one.

120
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,111
I was sentenced to die
by lethal injection.

121
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:46,612
No friggin' way.

122
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,014
Trust me.

123
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:50,549
You'll want to save your "no
friggin' way" for the next part,

124
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:53,019
where my execution
was faked by a secret unit

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,354
of the government
called "Division".

126
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:59,125
They told me they were
giving me a second chance.

127
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:01,627
They told me I'd be
serving my country.

128
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,629
What they didn't tell me

129
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:06,632
was they were training me
to be an assassin.

130
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,635
They're probably telling some other
girl the same thing right now.

131
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,138
It was a year of training

132
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:16,642
before my first mission, sort of
like a military charm school.

133
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:18,644
Everything to make me
the best killer I could be...

134
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:21,480
till I broke
one of their rules.

135
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:23,182
What rule?

136
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:27,453
I fell in love.

137
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:30,656
With a civilian.

138
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,560
His name was Daniel.

139
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,762
After 3 months together,

140
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:39,899
all I wanted to do
was be with him.

141
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:41,267
Live a normal life

142
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:44,704
but Division
couldn't have that,

143
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:46,772
so they killed him and made
it look like an accident.

144
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,874
Why are you telling me
all of this?

145
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:51,110
You know why, Gary.

146
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:52,678
They're still after me.

147
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:55,214
And I know they've been
keeping tabs on you

148
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:56,882
in case I showed up.

149
00:09:56,984 --> 00:10:00,186
It's ok.

150
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,921
I want them to know I'm here.

151
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:06,292
I want you to tell them
everything I just told you.

152
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:08,594
I want to send them a message.

153
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:13,199
It ends now.

154
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:42,454
This is surveillance
of general Safwani

155
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:44,556
entering the Wyckland hotel.

156
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:47,058
3 bodyguards in his suite,
one advance guard in the lobby.

157
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:48,660
Lobby guard is our weak link.

158
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,161
That's our way in.

159
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:51,896
We have one shot at this.

160
00:10:51,964 --> 00:10:53,765
If he makes it to
the U.N., we fail.

161
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,967
What's the team look like?

162
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:57,369
It's a 4-man op.

163
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,371
One of my recruits, Thom,
is ready for the field.

164
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,006
And I was planning on using...

165
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:04,776
Percy.

166
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,778
Really?

167
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:09,080
When?

168
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:11,416
No, I'll be right there.

169
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:17,088
I'm taking you off
operation black arrow.

170
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,590
Giving you a new assignment.

171
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:19,691
What?

172
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,695
Nikita? Nikita.

173
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:25,130
She's back on the radar.

174
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:27,432
Sprung one of our mouse traps.

175
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,035
I want you to hunt her down,

176
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:32,103
and I want you
to confirm the kill.

177
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:33,905
Do you think you can
do that this time?

178
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,642
What do you think?

179
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,476
What?

180
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,047
What are you looking at, bitch?

181
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:18,950
You're going to die here,
you know that?

182
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:22,487
What the hell are you doing?!

183
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:25,857
If you don't think they watch
us in here, you're wrong!

184
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,194
Hey.

185
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,062
I'd put that down
if I were you.

186
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:35,667
I love it when
you hold me like this.

187
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:38,470
God. Chill.

188
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:39,771
Just saying hi to the new girl.

189
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,707
This is Jaden.
She doesn't think

190
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:45,210
she's still new
here, but she is.

191
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:47,112
What's your name?

192
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:48,480
What's yours?

193
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:49,581
This is Thom.

194
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,182
He's a pro,

195
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,284
'cause he's about to go
on his first mission.

196
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:54,319
Shut up.

197
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,222
Look, we're recruits,
just like you.

198
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:58,923
I've been in almost a year,

199
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:01,393
they brought Jaden in
about 2 months ago.

200
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:04,195
None of us are volunteers.

201
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:07,058
Meaning, whatever they're got on you,

202
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:09,801
whatever your big bad past is,

203
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:11,661
it's nothing we haven't
heard before.

204
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:13,705
Meaning we need
to stick together

205
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,206
if we're going to make
it through training.

206
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:16,808
Trust me.

207
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,610
Now, you can start

208
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:20,044
by telling us your name.

209
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:22,947
Alex.

210
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:27,652
Amanda's ready to see you.

211
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:38,430
Yeah, well understand this...

212
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,031
FBI is paying
for all this damage,

213
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:42,233
'cause this is going
a bit beyond

214
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,935
the call of duty.

215
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,171
Hey!

216
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:47,572
Hey!

217
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,642
She didn't go
into the bathroom!

218
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:52,277
Did she say anything else?

219
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,979
Man, we've been over this
50 freakin' times already.

220
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,648
What do you think she meant
by "it ends now"?

221
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,149
I don't know.

222
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:01,453
'Cause I kinda lost focus

223
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,855
once she went into the
whole James Bond thing.

224
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:06,858
I'm talking about her tone.
Was she tired?

225
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:08,293
Did she want to surrender?
Did she want to give up?

226
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,862
Man, I wasn't concentrating
on her tone,

227
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:13,898
'cause my wrist...

228
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,967
I'm all set.

229
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,471
Don't worry, I'll clean it.

230
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,607
Roan.

231
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:24,809
I was talking to him.

232
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:29,180
Nikita knew what
we would have to do.

233
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:32,917
I don't think
she liked this guy.

234
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,110
Your job's too stressful.
Let it go.

235
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:01,412
You know I can't, Daniel.

236
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:05,350
The airline will find
another consultant.

237
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,119
Too much would have to change.

238
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:10,822
How much?

239
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:16,056
âª Trying to talk
my way out of this âª

240
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:18,863
Like this much?

241
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:24,435
Don't get too excited,
it's just the box.

242
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,043
Daniel!

243
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:35,146
It's beautiful!

244
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,050
I think you broke a rib.

245
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,451
I did?

246
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,186
Which one?

247
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,990
This one? Well...

248
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:47,659
Keep going, I'm not sure.

249
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,762
Oh! Hey!

250
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,967
Promise me something.

251
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,869
Right now, anything.

252
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,505
Promise me it's not a dream...

253
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:03,875
I'm going to wake up from
tomorrow. Right now, anything.

254
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:07,912
Shh, shh, shh.

255
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,603
It's Nikita.

256
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:36,908
It's definitely her. I got a hit on the
pressure senser, pulled up athenasat, boom.

257
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:42,313
Took her 3 years, but she's
finally paying her respects.

258
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,316
That, or she's finally snapped.

259
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:47,118
Go ahead and assemble a team.

260
00:16:47,152 --> 00:16:49,654
We're in closer proximity
to her here than Michael is.

261
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:50,922
She had a good run.

262
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:52,557
Won't be another one like her.

263
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,626
Don't be so sure.

264
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:02,533
Hello?

265
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:14,445
Well, don't just stand
there, Alex, try it on.

266
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,947
You'll find it fits perfectly.

267
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:18,049
I don't wear stuff like this.

268
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,385
As a style choice, or because
you're not used to it?

269
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:22,253
Because it's ugly.

270
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:24,255
And you're beautiful.

271
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:26,991
Michael was right
about that much.

272
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,795
So what?

273
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:32,864
You're the one that's
supposed to teach me

274
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:34,699
how to walk and talk,

275
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,267
chew with my mouth closed?

276
00:17:36,368 --> 00:17:37,602
My name is Amanda,

277
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,270
and I'm the one who's
going to show you

278
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:41,172
how to embrace your beauty

279
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:42,674
and use it to your advantage.

280
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:46,577
Your journey begins right
here in this chair.

281
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,880
I'm not smearing that crap
on my face.

282
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:50,581
It's not like this
will be the first time

283
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,684
you've reinvented
yourself, Alex.

284
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:56,320
I'm very impressed wit your
accent, or lack thereof.

285
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,331
How?

286
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:09,600
Well, based on your age now,

287
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:11,202
and taking into account
the 5 years or so

288
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:13,004
you'd have to work
to lose your accent.

289
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:15,206
It wasn't hard to
answer the question

290
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:17,108
what kind of 14 year
old Ukrainian girl

291
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,043
purchases a forged identity?

292
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:21,345
Someone who was brought here

293
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:23,648
against her will, on a boat,

294
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:27,295
with many and the girls just like her.

295
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,520
Not like me.

296
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,422
I escaped.

297
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:33,825
Your captors, yes, but not
the junk they hooked you on.

298
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:35,760
You're a survivor, Alex.

299
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:38,563
You made it through hell,
you'll make it through this.

300
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,066
All I'm here to show you is you
don't have to be hard to survive.

301
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:46,537
Sometimes vulnerability
can be our greatest weapon.

302
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:54,846
Position is unchanged.
Use caution. She will be armed.

303
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:06,190
Bye, Niki.

304
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:16,367
Execute.

305
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:25,610
Target on the move!

306
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,079
Target on the move.

307
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:29,680
North gate, north gate!

308
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:33,618
Radio back when
you have visual.

309
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:36,988
Good boy, Birkhoff.

310
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,825
What are you gonna do?

311
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,094
You'll see.

312
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:55,529
Ahh.
Congratulations, Birkhoff.

313
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,397
You found me.

314
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:01,601
What is that?
Truth serum?

315
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:04,104
It's pain desensitizer.

316
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:06,906
I don't want you
passing out on me.

317
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:10,610
So, what, you gonna torture me?
Is that it?

318
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,812
Not if you tell me
what I need to know.

319
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:14,647
Well, I always told you
you were hot.

320
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:15,615
You know that.

321
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,017
I want access
to Division's network.

322
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,220
Log-ins, passwords.

323
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:23,857
Bitch, just skip to the part
where you kill me.

324
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,225
No.

325
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,027
Seriously, do it!

326
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:29,429
Because if I give you
those codes,

327
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,265
Percy will kill me.
Shut up!

328
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:48,681
What do you want with the network?

329
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:51,851
Finding where it was
you've been hiding out.

330
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,253
I'm not hiding anymore.

331
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:54,754
Then what are you doing?

332
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:57,357
You're not trying
to come at us, are you?

333
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:04,264
Man. Niki...

334
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:06,266
Niki, you're insane.

335
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,800
Don't call me Niki.

336
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:09,302
Then don't call me nerd.

337
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,271
Remember you used
to call me that?

338
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:14,107
"Patch me through
to Michael, nerd.

339
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:18,611
This computer's busted,
fix it, nerd."

340
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,880
Place ain't the same
without you, babe.

341
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:22,615
Then let's burn it down.

342
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:26,386
You seriously think you can burn
down Division all on your own?

343
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,820
Who says I'm on my own?

344
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:31,191
So you playing
for the other side now?

345
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:35,795
Well, if you got such big guns
on your side backing you up,

346
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:38,198
what do you need me for?

347
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:42,101
Well, because they may be able
to get me the intel I need.

348
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:44,204
But I know you can get it.

349
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:46,940
Well, then we're right back
where we started.

350
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:49,309
Just understand,

351
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,543
if you do this,

352
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:52,712
you're going to have
to kill your way through

353
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,214
a whole lot of people you know.

354
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:56,816
Starting with me.

355
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,652
Niki.

356
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:08,828
We've got Birkhoff.

357
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,631
The signal interference
is gone.

358
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:14,534
His tracking implant's
back online.

359
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,269
Let's hope it's still
inside him.

360
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:35,054
She's long gone, guys.

361
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:38,091
Good hustle, though.
Very nice.

362
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:43,663
Someone want
to get me off this?

363
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,665
Michael, a little help here?

364
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,013
Ah, look.

365
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,681
All cleaned up.

366
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,716
You know, they say Amanda

367
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,385
can pretty up a pig.

368
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,287
You should go see her sometime.

369
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,792
He's intense.

370
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,093
He's about to go on
his first op.

371
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:15,528
He's just stressed.

372
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:18,131
Heh. Even though
he won't admit it.

373
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,899
You guys...

374
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,101
Division doesn't allow
relationships.

375
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:24,404
Who said anything
about a relationship?

376
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:29,042
New girl's a spitfire, Thom.

377
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,011
Maybe you can get him
to give it up.

378
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:34,714
We want to know about
operation Black Arrow.

379
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,150
Look, I told you, that's...

380
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,052
That's classified? God.

381
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,120
You sound like one of them now.

382
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:45,725
Come on. I know it's going
down at the Wyckland hotel.

383
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,227
Who told you that?

384
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:51,164
This is a spy school, Thom.

385
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:54,167
I spied on you googling
stuff at the computer lab.

386
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:57,870
The Wyckland hotel,
some west African V.I.P.

387
00:23:57,938 --> 00:24:01,741
General Sawani or
Sa-weenie or something.

388
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:03,476
You can get in trouble for that.

389
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:04,577
Please.

390
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:05,978
Who am I going to tell?

391
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:08,748
I'm just jealous
you get to smoke someone.

392
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:12,752
I mean, what are we
here for, right? What?

393
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,887
You disagree?

394
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,457
What are we here for?

395
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:19,092
Really?

396
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,494
Ah, man.

397
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:23,062
Is she playing with me?

398
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:26,265
At least half of our
missions are counter intel.

399
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:28,067
Deep cover infiltrations...

400
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:30,670
and the other half?

401
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,505
You're here to kill
for the man, honey.

402
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,674
They're going to teach you
to kill with a gun.

403
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:37,110
They're going to teach you to kill
with your nails,

404
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:38,678
they're going to tell you
who to kill

405
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,780
and when to kill them.

406
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,582
And if you don't deliver,

407
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:44,584
they're going to kill you.

408
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,087
Jaden, you're up.

409
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,626
She's running out of options.

410
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:55,628
Ah. I mean,
if she can't crack me,

411
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,630
there's no way she's going
to crack this place.

412
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:00,099
She say who was working for?

413
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:01,801
No.

414
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,903
Honestly, I think it's a bluff.

415
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,138
I think she's on her own.

416
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:06,639
I mean, you should have
seen her, she was a wreck.

417
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,708
I was able to turn
the tables on her easy.

418
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:10,410
Yeah, was that before or after

419
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:13,246
she duct-taped you to that
springy rocking horse?

420
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:15,314
The only reason
why you're alive

421
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,016
is because she wanted you that way.

422
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,217
We need to suspend
all operations

423
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:19,318
until we can contain this.

424
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,821
As long as she's out
there, she's a threat.

425
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:25,525
Threats are what we put down
using our resources.

426
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,227
Nikita is a complication.

427
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:29,262
If you believe Birkhoff.

428
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,130
I'm telling the truth, Michael.

429
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,633
And she didn't kill me
because she likes me.

430
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:37,837
Think you're just jealous
she didn't ask about you.

431
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,138
Where are you going?

432
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,139
Joint intelligence

433
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:41,641
fundraiser tonight.
I've gotta put in

434
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:42,975
an appearance.
For the record,

435
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,143
I'm not going to let a piece

436
00:25:44,178 --> 00:25:45,845
of street trash
slow down this operation.

437
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:48,181
Not for one minute.
All operations are go,

438
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:50,683
including Black Arrow.

439
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:54,854
âª Ooh âª

440
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:59,292
âª ooh âª

441
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,462
âª ooh âª

442
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:06,466
âª ooh âª

443
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:10,970
âª ooh âª

444
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:13,873
âª ooh âª

445
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:18,377
âª how, how did I do this?âª

446
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:22,181
âª me, I put the wall
around my heart âª

447
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:26,285
âª why didn't I notice âª

448
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,722
âª such a cold detachment
from the start? âª

449
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,326
âª without joy, joy,
joy in the rain âª

450
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:37,730
âª I could feel
forever the same âª

451
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,732
âª ooh âª

452
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:51,571
The united
nations aims to end civil war

453
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:53,607
in a region plagued
by warring factions.

454
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:56,910
He's going to eat.
One hour.

455
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,714
Get the car ready.

456
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:03,784
The car is ready.

457
00:27:03,818 --> 00:27:06,720
Lobby's clear.
Take your time.

458
00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:15,529
Hey!

459
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:16,630
This is my water.

460
00:27:16,698 --> 00:27:17,998
Oh, I'm sorry.

461
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:19,199
I thought this was left here
by another guest.

462
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:20,534
Would you like a new one?

463
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:22,302
No.

464
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,534
Towel, sir?

465
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:14,187
Four is down.

466
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,558
Gardiah.

467
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,660
Gardiah, what's wrong?

468
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:24,297
Gardiah, what's wrong?

469
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,069
Go check it out.

470
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:33,573
That should do it.

471
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:34,808
Phew.

472
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:37,477
I hope so.

473
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:02,536
That could have gone better.

474
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:28,628
Gardiah is out.

475
00:29:28,729 --> 00:29:31,464
Gardiah's out, Gardiah's out.

476
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:29,890
No, show your...

477
00:31:14,835 --> 00:31:16,636
General,

478
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:19,472
wake up. You're at
the united nations.

479
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,874
What are you doing?

480
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:22,542
You can't do this to me.

481
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:24,744
Do what, save your life?

482
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:26,479
I hope you noticed.

483
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:27,781
The kill squad
just tried to take you out

484
00:31:27,848 --> 00:31:30,050
before you could make it to
your peace summit tomorrow.

485
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:33,353
You're an American.

486
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:34,854
I'm an ally of
the United States.

487
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:37,257
The United States
didn't attack you.

488
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,358
One of their weapons did;

489
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:39,893
A weapon they've
lost control of.

490
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:41,261
A unit called Division.

491
00:31:41,362 --> 00:31:42,696
I don't understand.

492
00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:44,864
It's simple.
Your country's rich with oil

493
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:46,366
but you don't own any of it.

494
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:47,968
The companies that drill it do.

495
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:50,503
They know they minute that
you stabilize your country,

496
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:51,972
the second you end civil war,

497
00:31:52,006 --> 00:31:53,573
you'll kick 'em out.

498
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:56,076
Those companies contracted
Division to kill you.

499
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,211
How do you know this?

500
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,779
Who are you?

501
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:02,015
I'm someone who wants
to see Division fail.

502
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:06,886
Peace.

503
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:22,455
Well, hello, Alex.

504
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:24,657
It's good to see you again.

505
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,994
I was, um...

506
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:32,198
I was wondering
if you could help me.

507
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:35,201
Well, of course.
It's what I'm here for.

508
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,111
Tell me how I can help.

509
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:42,008
You can help me get out of here.
Alex... Shut up!

510
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:43,376
We're going to walk
to the elevator,

511
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,078
you're going to open it,
and I'm going to get in it.

512
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:46,679
And go where?

513
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,381
I didn't kill anyone.

514
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:52,018
But I swear to God,
if you don't get up right now,

515
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,786
I will kill you.

516
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,922
The elevator doesn't
lead to freedom.

517
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,924
Just another room.

518
00:32:57,992 --> 00:32:59,225
What?

519
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:01,327
The more you try to get out,

520
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:02,795
the more you realize

521
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:05,398
there will always be
another room.

522
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:10,303
I don't know who told
you these things, Alex.

523
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,705
We're not murderers.

524
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,408
We're protectors.
We protect our home.

525
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:17,410
What home?

526
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:19,712
Home is wherever
you stop running.

527
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,314
You haven't been
home for so long,

528
00:33:21,348 --> 00:33:22,515
you probably forget what
it even feels like.

529
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:24,417
Well, it begins...

530
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:27,754
It begins with a pro.

531
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:29,622
You promise
to put down the shears.

532
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:32,025
I promise to forget
this ever happened,

533
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:34,427
and we begin again.

534
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:46,739
Welcome home.

535
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:05,191
Glad you're able to be
here tonight, Percy.

536
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:06,292
Makes one of us.

537
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,894
John, what did you want
to tell me

538
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:09,362
that I couldn't hear
on the phone?

539
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:12,598
The CIA has made
my committee aware

540
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,368
of some very high level
espionage activities.

541
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,570
Kidnappings, assassinations.

542
00:34:17,604 --> 00:34:20,373
It's clearly the work of a
skilled intelligence network.

543
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:21,707
But we can't attribute it

544
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:23,176
to any one of our enemies.

545
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:25,611
Or allies.

546
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,180
You come across
anything like that?

547
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:30,483
Not that I'm aware of.

548
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,187
Hey, you work for us,
remember that.

549
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:37,824
I work for whoever happens
to be sitting in your chair.

550
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:40,493
That person tends
to come and go.

551
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,998
Black Arrow was blown.

552
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:48,034
Nikita sabotaged the op.

553
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:49,735
Then what the hell are
you doing here find her!

554
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:51,204
We need to pull in
assets from the field.

555
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:52,805
We trained Nikita
to be a ghost.

556
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:54,240
Finding her when she
doesn't want to be found

557
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:56,609
is next to impossible.

558
00:34:56,643 --> 00:34:58,811
Hey, guys.

559
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:09,922
I thought I heard my name.

560
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:13,126
How did you get in here?
Front door.

561
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:14,227
Like you.

562
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:16,229
Who are you bothering now?

563
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,165
What, I can't mingle?

564
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,067
She's been behaving
herself, senator.

565
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,535
I'm sorry, I didn't
get your name.

566
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:24,537
Oh. Nikita.

567
00:35:24,638 --> 00:35:26,339
Beautiful.

568
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,874
Your daughter?

569
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:29,842
Family friend.

570
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,644
Yes. Shall...

571
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,212
I'm sorry.

572
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,234
We better get some
seltzer on that.

573
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:37,409
That's right, that's right.
This way, senator.

574
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:43,656
If you think senator Marcus

575
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,158
is going to be leverage,

576
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,959
he's not.

577
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:48,361
He was just my ticket tonight.

578
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:50,563
I found out what
escort service he used

579
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:52,665
and I worked it
so I was his date.

580
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:55,601
Well, you've been planning
this for a while, huh?

581
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:58,804
I want you to know
I can get to you,

582
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,806
and hit you where
it hurts the most.

583
00:36:00,874 --> 00:36:03,176
My feelings?
Your funding.

584
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,410
Tonight was just a taste.

585
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:07,713
I'm going to take you apart,
piece by piece,

586
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:10,383
mission by mission.

587
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:14,587
Didn't you accompany me
to one of these once?

588
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,990
Yes.

589
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:19,625
5 years ago.

590
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:22,428
You needed some arm candy
to distract some v.I.P.

591
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:25,097
I'm surprised
you remember that.

592
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,334
I remember everything.
Ah.

593
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:30,703
Which is why I decided to bring
along a little back-up tonight.

594
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,109
And I'm afraid I'm going to
have to decline your offer.

595
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:41,514
You know this doesn't
have to be awkward.

596
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:45,418
Just take my arm and we'll
go right out that door.

597
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,822
We can do it quiet,
or the other way.

598
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,123
Your choice.

599
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,025
No, Percy, it's yours.

600
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,461
And you just made it.

601
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:16,549
Ah, stay here.

602
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:28,961
Nikita!

603
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,855
Safety on.

604
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,991
Toss it behind you,
don't turn around.

605
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:47,897
Get down on the ground.

606
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:48,765
Slowly.

607
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,067
Spread your arms and your legs.

608
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,671
Just like old times, huh?

609
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,273
Shut up.

610
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,074
You were free.

611
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,376
You had gotten out,
you were gone.

612
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,978
What the hell
are you doing back here?

613
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,880
Someone has to stop Percy.

614
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,682
If Percy goes down,
he has no problem

615
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,083
taking everybody down with him.

616
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,785
This country will not recover.

617
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,086
Do you want that?

618
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,888
What are you talking about?

619
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,091
I'm talking about evidence
of every job Division has had,

620
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,027
locked away in encrypted files,

621
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,095
hidden all over the world.

622
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,931
So he gets a free pass?

623
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,699
Keep training slaves
to kill for him?

624
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,534
Spare me, Nikita.

625
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,436
I know you're in this
for revenge.

626
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,405
You blame me?

627
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:31,208
You know firsthand
what it feels like.

628
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,810
Have the thing you love most
in life taken away from you.

629
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:38,215
It wasn't your life.
It was your cover.

630
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,451
I warned you not to get
emotionally attached.

631
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,853
You mean the way you did...

632
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,922
With me?

633
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,358
Don't. Don't.

634
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,261
Michael, I know why
you're staying there.

635
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,462
You want to protect
the other recruits

636
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,130
the way you protected me.

637
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:57,467
I can't protect you anymore.

638
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,638
Then let me go.

639
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,339
Or stop me now.

640
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,582
I'll give you a head start.

641
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,655
If we meet again I can't
promise what will happen.

642
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:24,160
I can.

643
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,269
It's a good wound.
They'll think you tried to stop me.

644
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,004
Just trying to protect you.

645
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:41,011
Nikita is our new
priority target.

646
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,780
Threat level 6.

647
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,783
Every operative engaged
at that level or lower

648
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,286
will be working on this
full time.

649
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,187
Mike will be heading
the detail.

650
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,025
Amanda will be directing
our overseas assets.

651
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,294
There's really only
a handful of organizations

652
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,295
who could intercept
our intelligence.

653
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,529
Someone is running her,

654
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,697
and I want to know who.

655
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,632
Bring me her head

656
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,601
and bring me all of theirs.

657
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,336
This is war!

658
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,838
Now get to work.

659
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,862
I'm never gonna get this.

660
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,699
Yeah, someone else
told me that once.

661
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,572
She was wrong, too.

662
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,575
Remember, you're just
getting started.

663
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,383
Damn right.

664
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,308
Here we go.

665
00:41:52,309 --> 00:42:00,309
