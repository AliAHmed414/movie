1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,926
My name is Nikita.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,440
Six years ago,
I was taken out of prison...

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,685
...and forced by a covert unit
of the government to be an assassin.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,121
Three years ago, I escaped,
and have been hunted ever since.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,964
I was the first recruit to get out.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,202
I'm going to make certain
I'm not the last.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,843
Come on.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,209
Come on, come OH, come on.

10
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,680
Let's go.

11
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,446
- Stay right there.
- Don't move.

12
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,928
She's just a kid.

13
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,044
Taking this one down to solitary.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,725
Watch out. She's a biter.

15
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,402
They're gonna love you down here.

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,807
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,448
Please. No!

18
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,086
Evening, Alex.

19
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,687
It is Alex, right? Never Alexandra?

20
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,370
Who are you?

21
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,966
Where am I?

22
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,448
Well, you're not in prison anymore.

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,845
You're not even in Michigan.

24
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,361
Although we're the only ones
that know that.

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,001
Your death was officially ruled a suicide
by the prison coroner on November 1st.

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,164
Your ashes are stored right here.

27
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,565
My name's Michael.
I work for the government.

28
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,087
We've decided to give you
a second chance.

29
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,120
Why? Why me?

30
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,965
Because you're a young, attractive,
white female...

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,686
...with virtually no personal ties
or a paper trail.

32
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,003
Now, those do exist,
but they're hard to come by.

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,605
What really grabbed
our attention, though...

34
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,685
...is how you managed to kill a criminal
we were about to take out.

35
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,966
His name was Kyle, by the way.
He was part of a smuggling ring.

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,770
Stand and your wrist breaks.

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,201
I didn't kill no one. It was Ronnie.

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,724
Your boyfriend's body was found next to
his apartment, dead from an overdose.

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,964
No one showed up
to his funeral, either.

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,490
Your life is over, Alex.

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,365
I'm here to offer you a new one.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,843
But you have to be willing to earn it.

43
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,049
What do I gotta do?

44
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,569
Learn.

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,849
How not to sound
like a teen meth whore, for starters.

46
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,970
Learn to stand up straight.

47
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,646
Learn how to walk right.

48
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,766
Learn how to talk right.

49
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,045
Learn how to serve your country
instead of just yourself.

50
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,800
Nikita.

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,011
Nikita.

52
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,522
Never seen you before, Nikita.

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,046
Who brought you here?

54
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,210
Elena. Yelena?

55
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,091
She said there was a cool party,
so, uh, here I am.

56
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,563
Come, have a drink.

57
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,927
I was kind of hoping to stay dry.

58
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,243
- Why don't we go to the bar?
- As you say, this is a cool party.

59
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,923
If you wanna stay,
you're gonna have to get wet.

60
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,921
That wasn't so bad, was it?

61
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,362
I would have preferred the bar.

62
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,844
It's just that this is gonna make
taking your bodyguard out...

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,809
...so much harder.

64
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,925
Target's down. I need extraction
at the servant's entrance.

65
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,044
- Negative. Extraction impossible.
- What?

66
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,441
You always had trouble
listening, didn't you?

67
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,921
Michael, please,
I need to get out of here.

68
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,805
You still don't hear me. I told you.

69
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,088
There is no out.

70
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,767
- Hi, Gary.
- Hi, Gary?

71
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,640
That's a nice touch, honey,
but I ain't buying anything.

72
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,522
All right. Let's try this again.

73
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,881
Hi, Daddy.

74
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,446
Nikita.

75
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,330
Wow. You really let this place go
after Caroline died.

76
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,411
I guess no more foster kids like me
to clean up your crap, either.

77
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,008
You... You broke my frigging wrist. Aah!

78
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,251
Sit up, Gary.
Try to pay attention, okay?

79
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,722
I need to tell you what happened to me
after I ran away.

80
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,003
It starts off like you'd expect
and then it gets a little weird.

81
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,367
- Nikita...
- After I ran away...

82
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,966
...I got with a pretty bad crowd.

83
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,203
I did a lot of drugs.

84
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,848
Anything that made me forget
about you.

85
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,169
Nikita, baby, that was 10 years ago.

86
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,601
It was 11. I'm 27 now.

87
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,969
If you call me "baby" again,
I'll break something else.

88
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,963
They told me I killed a cop.

89
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,162
I don't remember. I've tried to.

90
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,922
I'd just turned 18, so they were able
to charge me with murder one.

91
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,361
I was sentenced to die
by lethal injection.

92
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,201
- No frigging way.
- Trust me.

93
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,284
You'll wanna save your
"no frigging way" for the next part.

94
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,570
My execution was faked by a secret unit
of the government called Division.

95
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,684
They told me they were giving me
a second chance.

96
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,650
They told me
I'd be serving my country.

97
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,484
What they didn't tell me was...

98
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,881
...they were training me
to be an assassin.

99
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,765
They're probably telling some other girl
the same thing right now.

100
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,088
It was a year of training
before my first mission.

101
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,602
Sort of like a military charm school.

102
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,570
Everything to make me
the best killer I could be...

103
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,643
...till I broke one of their rules.

104
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,171
What rule?

105
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,167
I fell in love.

106
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,845
With a civilian. His name was Daniel.

107
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,528
After three months together...

108
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,441
...all I wanted to do was be with him,
live a normal life.

109
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,889
But Division couldn't have that.

110
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,526
So they killed him,
made it look like an accident.

111
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,526
- Why are you telling me all of this?
- You know why, Gary.

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,729
They're still after me.

113
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,123
And I know they've been keeping tabs
on you in case I showed up.

114
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,364
It's okay.

115
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,240
I want them to know I'm here.

116
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,445
I want you to tell them everything
I just told you.

117
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,483
I wanna send them a message.

118
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,331
It ends now.

119
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,961
This is surveillance of General
Safwani entering the Wyckland Hotel.

120
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,487
Three bodyguards in his suite,
one in the lobby.

121
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,166
Lobby guard is our weak link.
That's our way in.

122
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,322
We have one shot at this.

123
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,727
If he makes it to the U.N., we fail.

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,410
What's the team look like?

125
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,880
It's a four-man op.

126
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,281
One of my recruits, Thorn, is ready for
the field and I was planning on using him.

127
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,641
Percy.

128
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,169
Really?

129
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,567
When?

130
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,842
Look, I'll be right there.

131
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,528
I'm taking you off
Operation Black Arrow...

132
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,087
- ...giving you a new assignment.
- What?

133
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,090
- Nikita.
- Nikita?

134
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,762
She's back on the radar.
Sprung one of our mousetraps.

135
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,363
I want you to hunt her down
and I want you to confirm the kill.

136
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,285
Do you think
you can do that this time?

137
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,042
What do you think?

138
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,611
What?

139
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,450
What are you looking at, bitch?

140
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,483
You're gonna die here, you know that?

141
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,004
What the hell are you doing?

142
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,290
Look, if you don't think
they watch us in here, you're wrong.

143
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,240
Hey, I'd put that down if I were you.

144
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,010
I love it when you hold me like this.

145
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,849
God, chill.

146
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,651
I'm just saying hi to new girl.

147
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,289
This is Jaden. She doesn't think
she's still new here, but she is.

148
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,849
- What's your name?
- What's yours?

149
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,688
This is Thorn. He's a pro because
he's about to go on his first mission.

150
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,640
Shut up.
Look, we're recruits, just like you.

151
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,370
I've been in almost a year.

152
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,727
They brought Jaden in
about two months ago.

153
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,169
None of us are volunteers.

154
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,607
Meaning, whatever they got on you...

155
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,448
...whatever your big bad past is,
it's nothing we haven't heard before.

156
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,287
Meaning, we need to stick together
if we're gonna make it through training.

157
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,720
Trust me.

158
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,406
Now, you can start
by telling us your name.

159
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,203
Alex.

160
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,802
Amanda is ready to see you.

161
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,723
Yeah, well, understand this,
FBI's paying for all this damage...

162
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,049
...because this is going a bit beyond
the call of duty.

163
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,930
Hey.

164
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,164
Hey.

165
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,004
She didn't go into the bathroom.

166
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,770
Did she say anything else?

167
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,763
We've been over this
50 frigging times.

168
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,400
What do you think she meant by
"it ends now"?

169
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,090
I don't know. Ha.

170
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,207
Because I kind of lost focus when she
went into the whole James Bond thing.

171
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,090
I'm talking about her tone.

172
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,284
Was she tired? Did she wanna surrender?
Did she wanna give up?

173
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,808
Man, I wasn't concentrating on her tone
because my wrist...

174
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,364
I'm all set.

175
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,602
Don't worry, I'll clean him.

176
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,964
Roan, I was talking to him.

177
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,601
Nikita knew
what we would have to do.

178
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,088
I don't think she liked this guy.

179
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,481
If the job's too stressful, let it go.

180
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,169
You know I can't, Daniel.

181
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,648
The airline will find another consultant.

182
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,090
Too much would have to change.

183
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,327
How much?

184
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,283
About this much?

185
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,767
Now, don't get too excited.
It's just the box.

186
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,201
Daniel.

187
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,367
It's beautiful.

188
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,770
- I think you broke a rib.
- I did?

189
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,206
- Which one?
- Well...

190
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,408
This one?

191
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,011
Keep going. I'm not sure.

192
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,890
- Oh. Hey.
- Ha, ha.

193
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,327
Promise me something.

194
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,204
Right now, anything.

195
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,051
Promise me it's not a dream
that I'm gonna wake up from tomorrow.

196
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,844
It's Nikita. It's definitely her.

197
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,244
I got a hit on the pressure sensor
at Greenlawn, pulled up AthenaSat. Boom.

198
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,528
Took her three years
but she's finally paying her respects.

199
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,563
Well, she's finally snapped.
Look, go ahead and assemble a team.

200
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,041
We're in closer proximity to her
than Michael is.

201
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,966
She had a good run.
Won't be another one like her.

202
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,969
Don't be so sure.

203
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,208
Hello?

204
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,851
Well, don't just stand there, Alex.
Try it on.

205
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,447
- You'll find it fits perfectly.
- I don't wear stuff like this.

206
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,881
As a style choice,
or because you're not used to it?

207
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,651
Because it's ugly.

208
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,651
And you're beautiful.
Michael was right about that much.

209
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,882
So what?

210
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,084
You're supposed to teach me
how to walk and talk?

211
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,170
- Chew with my mouth closed?
- My name is Amanda.

212
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,529
And I'm the one who's going to show you
how to embrace your beauty.

213
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,324
And use it to your advantage.

214
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,007
Your journey begins right here,
in this chair.

215
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,288
I'm not smearing that crap
on my face.

216
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,486
It's not like this will be the first time
you've reinvented yourself, Alex.

217
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,042
We're all very impressed with your accent,
or lack thereof.

218
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,687
How?

219
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,009
Well, based on your age now...

220
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,528
...and the five years or so you'd have
to work to lose your accent...

221
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,648
...it wasn't hard
to answer the question...

222
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,361
...what kind of 14-year-old Ukrainian girl
purchases a forged identity?

223
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,684
Someone who was brought here
against her will, on a boat...

224
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,162
...with many other girls just like her?

225
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,762
Not like me. I escaped.

226
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,571
Your captors, yes,
but not the junk they hooked you on.

227
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,330
You're a survivor, Alex.

228
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,051
You made it through hell,
you'll make it through this.

229
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,363
All I'm here to show you is
you don't have to be hard to survive.

230
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,690
Sometimes vulnerability can be
our greatest weapon.

231
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,969
Position is unchanged.
Use caution, she will be armed.

232
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,043
Bye, Nikki.

233
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,484
Execute.

234
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,765
Target on the move.

235
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,361
Target on the move.

236
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,840
North gate. North gate.

237
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,921
Radio back when you have visual.

238
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,168
Good boy, Birkhoff.

239
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,285
What are you gonna do?

240
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,245
You'll see.

241
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,444
Congratulations, Birkhoff.
You found me.

242
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,285
What is that, truth serum?

243
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,568
It's pain desensitizer.

244
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,127
I don't want you passing out on me.

245
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,642
So, what, you gonna torture me?
Is that it?

246
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,041
Not if you tell me
what I need to know.

247
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,925
I always told you you were hot,
you know that.

248
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,248
I want access to Division's network.

249
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,406
Logins, passwords.

250
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,086
Bitch, just skip to the part
where you kill me.

251
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,927
No.

252
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,326
Seriously, do it.

253
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,881
If I give you those codes,
Percy will kill me.

254
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,326
Shut up.

255
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,040
What do you want
with the network, anyway?

256
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,130
It's not like it was any help to us
finding where you've been hiding out.

257
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,290
- I'm not hiding anymore.
- Then what are you doing?

258
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,290
You're not trying to come at us,
are you?

259
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,444
Oh, man.

260
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,364
Nikki...

261
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,601
Nikki, you're insane.

262
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,165
Don't call me Nikki.

263
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,489
Then don't call me "nerd."
Remember you used to call me that?

264
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,327
"Patch me through to Michael, nerd."

265
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,962
"This computer's busted.
Fix it, nerd."

266
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,208
Place ain't the same without you, babe.

267
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,449
Then let's burn it down.

268
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,729
You seriously think you can burn down
Division all on your own?

269
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,121
Who says I'm on my own?

270
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,324
So you're playing
for the other side now?

271
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,966
Well, if you've got such big guns
on your side backing you up...

272
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,163
...what do you need me for?

273
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,722
Well, because they may be able
to get me the intel I need...

274
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,524
...but I know you can get it.

275
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
Well, then,
we're right back where we started.

276
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,570
Just understand...

277
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,563
...if you do this...

278
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,486
...you're gonna have to kill your way
through a whole lot of people you know.

279
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,686
Starting with me, Nikki.

280
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,681
We've got Birkhoff.

281
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,329
The signal interference is gone.
His tracking implant's back online.

282
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,608
Well, let's hope it's still inside him.

283
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,683
She's long gone, guys.

284
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,764
Good hustle, though. Very nice.

285
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,284
Someone wanna get me off this?

286
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,122
Michael, little help here?

287
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,481
Oh, look, all cleaned up.

288
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,041
You know they say
Amanda can pretty up a pig.

289
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,891
Then you should go see her sometime.

290
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,526
He's intense.

291
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,247
He's about to go on his first op.
He's just stressed.

292
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,811
Even though he won't admit it.

293
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,810
Are you guys...?

294
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,090
- Division doesn't allow relationships.
- Who said anything about a relationship?

295
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,644
New girl's a spitfire, Thorn.

296
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,401
Maybe you can get him to give it up.

297
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,450
We wanna know
about Operation Black Arrow.

298
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,530
- Look, I told you, that's...
- That's classified?

299
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,808
God, you sound like one of them now.

300
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,846
Come on, I know it's going down
at the Wyckland Hotel.

301
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,763
Who told you that?

302
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,809
This is spy school, Thorn.

303
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,844
I spied on you Googling stuff
in the computer lab.

304
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,125
The Wyckland Hotel,
some West African VIP...

305
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,966
...General Sawani or Saweenie
or something.

306
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,681
- You could get in trouble for that.
- Please, who am I gonna tell?

307
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,360
I'm just jealous
you get to smoke someone.

308
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,368
I mean, what are we here for, right?

309
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,523
What, you disagree?

310
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,726
What are we here for, really?

311
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,688
Oh, man. Is she playing with me?

312
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,281
At least half of our missions
are counterintel.

313
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,528
Deep cover infiltration,
stealing secrets...

314
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,321
- And the other half?
- You're here to kill for the Man, honey.

315
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,845
They're gonna teach you to kill with
a gun, teach you to kill with your nails.

316
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,249
They're gonna tell you who to kill
and when to kill them.

317
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,246
And if you don't deliver,
they're gonna kill you.

318
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,726
Jaden, you're up.

319
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,440
She's running out of options.

320
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,361
Ah. I mean, if she can't crack me, there's
no way she's gonna crack this place.

321
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,491
- She say who she was working for?
- No.

322
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,609
Honestly, I think it's a bluff.

323
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,321
I think she's on her own.
I mean, she was a wreck.

324
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,568
I was able to turn the tables
on her easy.

325
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,371
Yeah. Was that before or after
she duct-taped you...

326
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,602
...to that springy rocking horse?

327
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,922
You're alive
because she wanted you that way.

328
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,129
We need to suspend all operations
until we can contain this.

329
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,442
As long as she's out there,
she's a threat.

330
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,685
Threats are what we put down
using our resources.

331
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,083
- Nikita is a complication.
- If you believe Birkhoff.

332
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,765
I'm telling the truth, Michael.

333
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,611
And she didn't kill me
because she likes me.

334
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,441
I think you're just jealous
she didn't ask about you.

335
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,646
- Where are you going?
- Joint-intelligence fundraiser.

336
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,802
Gotta put in an appearance.
For the record?

337
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,965
I'm not gonna let a piece of street trash
slow this operation. Not for one minute.

338
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,283
All operations are go,
including Black Arrow.

339
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,971
Tomorrow's
peace summit at the United Nations...

340
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,647
...aims to end civil war
in a region plagued by warring factions.

341
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,525
He's going to eat. One hour.

342
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,722
Get the car ready.

343
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,530
The car is ready. Lobby's clear.
Take your time.

344
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,887
Hey. This is my water.

345
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,771
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was left here
by another guest.

346
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,247
- Would you like a new one?
- No.

347
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,523
Towel, sir?

348
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,728
Four is down.

349
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,607
Gardiah. Gardiah, what's wrong?

350
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,921
Gardiah, what's wrong?

351
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,042
Go check it out.

352
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,768
That should do it.

353
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,641
I hope so.

354
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,482
That could have gone better.

355
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,007
Gardiah down.

356
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,841
Gardiah down. Gardiah down.

357
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,565
You, show your hands.

358
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,528
I'll kill you.

359
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,726
General, wake up.
You're at the United Nations.

360
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,005
What are you doing?
You can't do this to me.

361
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,964
Do what, save your life?

362
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,726
I hope you noticed.

363
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,970
A kill squad tried to take you out before
you could make it to your peace summit.

364
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,449
You're American.
I'm an ally of the United States.

365
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,843
The United States didn't attack you.
One of their weapons did.

366
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,520
A weapon they've lost control of,
a unit called Division.

367
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,006
I don't understand.

368
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,608
It's simple. Your country's rich with oil
but you don't own any of it.

369
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,731
The companies that drill it do. They know
the minute you stabilize your country...

370
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,282
...the second you end civil war,
you'll kick them out.

371
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,886
Those companies contracted Division
to kill you.

372
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,010
How do you know this? Who are you?

373
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,050
I'm someone who wants to see
Division fail.

374
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,850
Peace.

375
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,001
Hey.

376
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,522
Well, hello, Alex.
It's good to see you again.

377
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,369
I was, um...

378
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,924
I was wondering if you could help me.

379
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,721
Of course. It's what I'm here for.

380
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,201
Tell me how I can help.

381
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,848
- You can help me get out of here.
- Alex...

382
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,644
Shut up.

383
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,049
We're gonna walk to the elevator,
you're gonna open it, I'm gonna get in it.

384
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,281
And go where?

385
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,365
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't wanna kill anyone.

386
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,445
But I swear to God, if you don't get up
right now, I will kill you.

387
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,802
The elevator doesn't lead to freedom.

388
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,725
- Just another room.
- What?

389
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,083
The more you try to get out...

390
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,687
...the more you realize
there will always be another room.

391
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,683
I don't know
who told you these things, Alex.

392
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,406
We're not murderers, we're protectors.

393
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,925
We protect our home.

394
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,921
What home?

395
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,562
Home is wherever you stop running.
You haven't been home for so long...

396
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,963
...you probably forget
what it even feels like or how it begins.

397
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,241
It begins with a promise.

398
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,202
You promise to put down the shears,
I promise to forget this ever happened.

399
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,731
And we begin again.

400
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,602
Welcome home.

401
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,130
- Glad you're able to be here, Percy.
- That makes one of us.

402
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,204
John, what did you wanna tell me
that I couldn't hear on the phone?

403
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,325
The, uh, CIA has made my committee

404
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,290
aware of some very high-level
espionage activities.

405
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,763
Kidnappings, assassinations.

406
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,321
It's the work
of a skilled intelligence network...

407
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,441
...but we can't attribute it
to any of our enemies, or allies.

408
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,326
You come across anything like that?

409
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,131
Not that I'm aware of.

410
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,048
Hey, hey, you work for us.
Remember that.

411
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,604
I work for whoever happens to be sitting
in your chair.

412
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,130
That person tends to come and go.

413
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,843
Black Arrow was blown.
Nikita sabotaged the op.

414
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,843
Then what are you doing here?
Find her.

415
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,810
I need to pull in assets.
We trained Nikita to be a ghost.

416
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,362
Finding her when she doesn't want
to be found is next to impossible.

417
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,562
Hey, guys.

418
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,484
- Thought I heard my name.
- How did you get in here?

419
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,041
Front door, like you.

420
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,688
- Who are you bothering now?
- Ha, ha.

421
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,325
What, I can't mingle?

422
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,006
Well, she's been behaving herself,
senator.

423
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,363
- I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
- Oh, Nikita.

424
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,888
Beautiful.

425
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,691
- Your daughter?
- Family friend.

426
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,564
- Yes. Shall...?
- Damn.

427
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,690
- I'm sorry.
- You better get some seltzer on that.

428
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,884
- That's right, that's right. This way, sir.
- I'll wait for you.

429
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,803
If you think Senator Markus
is gonna be leverage, he's not.

430
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,008
He's just my ticket tonight.

431
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,846
Found out what escort service he used
and I worked it so I was his date.

432
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,247
Well, you've been planning this
for a while, huh?

433
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,641
I want you to know I can get to you
and hit you where it hurts the most.

434
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,008
- My feelings?
- Your funding.

435
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,089
Tonight was just a taste.

436
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,245
I'm gonna take you apart,
piece by piece, mission by mission.

437
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,405
Didn't you accompany me
to one of these once?

438
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,850
Yes. Five years ago.

439
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,288
You needed some arm candy
to distract some VIP.

440
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,649
- I'm surprised you remember that.
- I remember everything.

441
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,206
Oh.

442
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,409
Which is why I decided to bring along
a little backup tonight.

443
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,649
And why I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to decline your offer.

444
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,606
You know, this doesn't
have to be awkward.

445
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,683
Why don't you just take my arm
and we'll go right out that door?

446
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,640
You can go quiet or the other way.

447
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,804
- Your choice.
- No, Percy, it's yours.

448
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,244
And you just made it.

449
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,162
All right, stay here.

450
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,844
Nikita.

451
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,527
Safety on, toss it behind you.
Don't turn around.

452
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,524
Get down on the ground, slowly.

453
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,206
Spread your arms and your legs.

454
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,368
Just like old times, huh?

455
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,971
Shut up.

456
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,126
You were free. You had gotten out.

457
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,209
You were gone.
What the hell are you doing here?

458
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,044
Someone has to stop Percy.

459
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,369
If Percy goes down, he has no problem
taking everybody down with him.

460
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,965
This country will not recover.

461
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,124
- Do you want that?
- What are you talking about?

462
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,250
I'm talking about evidence
of every job Division has had...

463
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,202
...locked away in encrypted files,
hidden all over the world.

464
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,889
So he gets a free pass
to keep training slaves to kill for him?

465
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,608
Spare me, Nikita.
I know you're in this for revenge.

466
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,361
Can you blame me?
You know firsthand what it feels like.

467
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,087
Have the thing you love most in life
taken away from you.

468
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,404
It wasn't your life. It was your cover.

469
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,607
I warned you not to get
emotionally attached.

470
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,243
You mean the way you did? With me?

471
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,570
Don't. Don't.

472
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,406
Michael, I know why
you're staying there.

473
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,281
You wanna protect the other recruits
the way you protected me.

474
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,651
I can't protect you anymore.

475
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,769
Then let me go. Or stop me now.

476
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,488
I'll give you a head start.

477
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,651
If we meet again,
I can't promise what will happen.

478
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
I can.

479
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,486
It's a good wound.
They'll think you tried to stop me.

480
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,011
I'm just trying to protect you.

481
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,127
Nikita is our new priority target.

482
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,964
Threat level six.

483
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,490
Every operative engaged at that level
or lower will be working on this full-time.

484
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,241
Michael will be heading the detail.

485
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,330
Amanda will be directing
our overseas assets.

486
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,529
There's a handful of organizations
who could intercept our intelligence.

487
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,842
Someone is running her
and I want to know who.

488
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,325
Bring me her head
and bring me all of theirs.

489
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,481
This is war.

490
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,003
Now get to work.

491
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,051
Never gonna get this.

492
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,727
Yeah, someone else told me that once.

493
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,726
She was wrong too.

494
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,568
Remember, you're just getting started.

495
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,322
Damn right.

496
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,928
Here we go.

497
00:41:52,309 --> 00:42:00,309
