1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,228
My name is Nikita.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,952
6 years ago I was taken out of prison

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,460
and forced by a covert unit
of the government to be an assassin.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,927
3 years ago, I escaped,

5
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:20,263
and have been hunted
ever since.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,653
I was the first recruit
to get out.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,670
I'm going to make certain
I'm not the last.

8
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,923
Come on!

9
00:00:56,978 --> 00:01:00,300
Come on, come on, come on.

10
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,449
Aahh!

11
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,780
Stay right there!

12
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,452
Don't move!

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,034
She's just a kid.

14
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,399
Taking this one
down to solitary.

15
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,902
Watch out... She's a biter.

16
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,084
They're going to love you here.

17
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:10,921
I didn't do it!
I didn't do it!

18
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,915
Evening, Alex.

19
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:39,934
It is Alex, right?

20
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:41,532
Never Alexandra.

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,300
Who are you?

22
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,535
Where am I?

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,234
Well, you're not
in prison anymore.

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,635
You're not even in Michigan,

25
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,002
although we're the only
ones that know that.

26
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:59,069
Your death was officially
ruled a suicide

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,880
by the prison coroner
on November first.

28
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,294
Your ashes are stored
right here.

29
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:10,417
My name's Michael.

30
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:12,686
I work for the government.

31
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,002
We've decided to give
you a second chance.

32
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:18,536
Why?

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
Why me?

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,002
Because you're a young
attractive white female

35
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,238
with virtually no personal
ties or paper trail.

36
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,732
Now, those do exist,

37
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,901
but they're hard to come by.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,994
What really grabbed
our attention, though,

39
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,938
how you managed to kill a criminal
we were about to take out.

40
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:41,966
Aah! Ow!

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,665
His name was Kyle, by the way.
He was part of a smuggling ring.

42
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,732
Stand and your wrist breaks.
I didn't kill no one!

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,100
It was Ronnie!

44
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,201
Your boyfriend's body was
found next to his apartment,

45
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,635
dead from an overdose.

46
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,804
No one showed up
to his funeral, either.

47
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,601
Your life is over, Alex.

48
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:06,398
I'm here to offer you
a new one.

49
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,935
But you have to be
willing to earn it.

50
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,935
What do I gotta do?

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,001
Learn.

52
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:18,737
How not to sound like a teen
meth whore, for starters.

53
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,902
Learn to stand up straight.

54
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:24,737
Learn how to walk right.

55
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,857
Learn how to talk right.

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,868
Learn how to serve
your country...

57
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:36,382
Instead of just yourself.

58
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,364
Chica.

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,502
You.

60
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,239
Como te llamas?

61
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,734
Nikita.

62
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,033
Nikita.

63
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:22,777
Never seen you before, Nikita.

64
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,906
Who brought you here?

65
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:27,198
Elena. Yelena?

66
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:28,624
She said there was
a cool party,

67
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,303
so, uh, here I am.

68
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,242
Venga.

69
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
Come.

70
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,133
Have a drink.

71
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,201
I was kinda hoping to stay dry.

72
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,099
Why don't we go to the bar?

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,034
As you say,
this is a cool party.

74
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,936
If you want to stay, you're
going to have to get...wet.

75
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,002
That wasn't so bad, was it?

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,035
I would have preferred the bar.

77
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,304
It's just that

78
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,107
this is going to make
taking your bodyguard out

79
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,609
so much harder.

80
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,111
Como?

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,674
Target is down! I need extraction
at the service entrance.

82
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:35,735
Negative.

83
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,967
Extraction impossible.

84
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:38,503
What?

85
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:40,232
You always had trouble
listening, didn't you?

86
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,601
Michael! Please,
I need to get out of here.

87
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,404
Still don't hear me.
I told you.

88
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,908
There is no out.

89
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,200
Hi, Gary.

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,734
"Hi, Gary"?

91
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,502
That's a nice touch, honey,

92
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,504
but I ain't buying anything.

93
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:26,999
Ah, all right.

94
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,301
Let's try this again.

95
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,700
Hi, daddy.

96
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,686
Nikita...

97
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:44,851
Wow.

98
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,139
You really let this place
go after Caroline died.

99
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,700
I guess no more
foster kids like me

100
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:53,203
to clean up your crap, either.

101
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,736
You... you broke
my friggin' wrist! Ah!

102
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,266
Sit up, Gary.

103
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,668
Try to pay attention, ok?

104
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,803
I need to tell you what happened
to me after I ran away.

105
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,938
It starts off
like you'd expect,

106
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,698
and then it gets
a little weird.

107
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,733
Nikita...

108
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,100
After I ran away,

109
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:14,701
I got with a pretty bad crowd.

110
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:18,005
Did a lot of drugs.

111
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,601
Anything that made me
forget about you.

112
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,836
Nikita, baby,
that was 10 years ago.

113
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,238
It was 11. I'm 27 now.

114
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,966
If you call me baby again,
I'll break something else.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,668
They told me I killed a cop.

116
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,435
I don't remember.
I've tried to.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,334
I'd just turned 18,

118
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:41,504
so they were able to
charge me with murder one.

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,102
I was sentenced to die
by lethal injection.

120
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,600
No friggin' way.

121
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:47,002
Trust me.

122
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:49,537
You'll want to save your "no
friggin' way" for the next part,

123
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,002
where my execution
was faked by a secret unit

124
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,332
of the government
called "Division".

125
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,103
They told me they were
giving me a second chance.

126
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,601
They told me I'd be
serving my country.

127
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:02,604
What they didn't tell me

128
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:05,568
was they were training me
to be an assassin.

129
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:08,571
They're probably telling some other
girl the same thing right now.

130
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,099
It was a year of training

131
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,603
before my first mission, sort of
like a military charm school.

132
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,605
Everything to make me
the best killer I could be...

133
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:20,432
till I broke
one of their rules.

134
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,134
What rule?

135
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,369
I fell in love.

136
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,567
With a civilian.

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,500
His name was Daniel.

138
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,703
After 3 months together,

139
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:38,802
all I wanted to do
was be with him.

140
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,200
Live a normal life

141
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:43,637
but Division
couldn't have that,

142
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,765
so they killed him and made
it look like an accident.

143
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,867
Why are you telling me
all of this?

144
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,963
You know why, Gary.

145
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:51,380
They're still after me.

146
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,722
And I know they've been
keeping tabs on you

147
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:55,385
in case I showed up.

148
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:59,162
It's ok.

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,901
I want them to know I'm here.

150
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,705
I want you to tell them
everything I just told you.

151
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,501
I want to send them a message.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,102
It ends now.

153
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,399
This is surveillance
of general Safwani

154
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,501
entering the Wyckland hotel.

155
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,003
3 bodyguards in his suite,
one advance guard in the lobby.

156
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:47,602
Lobby guard is our weak link.

157
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,201
That's our way in.

158
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:50,936
We have one shot at this.

159
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,806
If he makes it to
the U.N., we fail.

160
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:54,901
What's the team look like?

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,367
It's a 4-man op.

162
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,365
One of my recruits, Thom,
is ready for the field.

163
00:10:58,365 --> 00:10:59,968
And I was planning on using...

164
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,738
Percy.

165
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,768
Really?

166
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:08,070
When?

167
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,335
No, I'll be right there.

168
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,007
I'm taking you off
operation black arrow.

169
00:11:16,162 --> 00:11:17,563
Giving you a new assignment.

170
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:18,664
What?

171
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,668
Nikita? Nikita.

172
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:24,103
She's back on the radar.

173
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,405
Sprung one of our mouse traps.

174
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:29,031
I want you to hunt her down,

175
00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:31,099
and I want you
to confirm the kill.

176
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,901
Do you think you can
do that this time?

177
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:36,638
What do you think?

178
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,401
What?

179
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,968
What are you looking at, bitch?

180
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,871
You're going to die here,
you know that?

181
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,432
What the hell are you doing?!

182
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,802
If you don't think they watch
us in here, you're wrong!

183
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:28,139
Hey.

184
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,964
I'd put that down
if I were you.

185
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,569
I love it when
you hold me like this.

186
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,469
God. Chill.

187
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:38,699
Just saying hi to the new girl.

188
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,635
This is Jaden.
She doesn't think

189
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,135
she's still new
here, but she is.

190
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,070
What's your name?

191
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,399
What's yours?

192
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
This is Thom.

193
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,100
He's a pro,

194
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,267
'cause he's about to go
on his first mission.

195
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,232
Shut up.

196
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,809
Look, we're recruits,
just like you.

197
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,269
I've been in almost a year,

198
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:00,404
they brought Jaden in
about 2 months ago.

199
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:03,206
None of us are volunteers.

200
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,069
Meaning, whatever they're got on you,

201
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:08,762
whatever your big bad past is,

202
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:10,622
it's nothing we haven't
heard before.

203
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:12,666
Meaning we need
to stick together

204
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,167
if we're going to make
it through training.

205
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,801
Trust me.

206
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,601
Now, you can start

207
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,032
by telling us your name.

208
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,935
Alex.

209
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,601
Amanda's ready to see you.

210
00:13:34,863 --> 00:13:37,365
Yeah, well understand this...

211
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,966
FBI is paying
for all this damage,

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,168
'cause this is going
a bit beyond

213
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:42,870
the call of duty.

214
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,131
Hey!

215
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:46,532
Hey!

216
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,602
She didn't go
into the bathroom!

217
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,234
Did she say anything else?

218
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:53,936
Man, we've been over this
50 freakin' times already.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,601
What do you think she meant
by "it ends now"?

220
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,100
I don't know.

221
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,369
'Cause I kinda lost focus

222
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,768
once she went into the
whole James Bond thing.

223
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:05,288
I'm talking about her tone.
Was she tired?

224
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:06,453
Did she want to surrender?
Did she want to give up?

225
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,779
Man, I wasn't concentrating
on her tone,

226
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,835
'cause my wrist...

227
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:14,904
I'm all set.

228
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,401
Don't worry, I'll clean it.

229
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,569
Roan.

230
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,734
I was talking to him.

231
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:28,105
Nikita knew what
we would have to do.

232
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,836
I don't think
she liked this guy.

233
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,102
Your job's too stressful.
Let it go.

234
00:14:58,135 --> 00:15:00,403
You know I can't, Daniel.

235
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,336
The airline will find
another consultant.

236
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,101
Too much would have to change.

237
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:09,804
How much?

238
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:15,038
âª Trying to talk
my way out of this âª

239
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:17,830
Like this much?

240
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,402
Don't get too excited,
it's just the box.

241
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,968
Daniel!

242
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:34,071
It's beautiful!

243
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
I think you broke a rib.

244
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,600
I did?

245
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:41,335
Which one?

246
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,934
This one? Well...

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,601
Keep going, I'm not sure.

248
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:49,704
Oh! Hey!

249
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,902
Promise me something.

250
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:57,283
Right now, anything.

251
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,920
Promise me it's not a dream...

252
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,227
I'm going to wake up from
tomorrow. Right now, anything.

253
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,222
Shh, shh, shh.

254
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:30,666
It's Nikita.

255
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:35,915
It's definitely her. I got a hit on the
pressure senser, pulled up athenasat, boom.

256
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,302
Took her 3 years, but she's
finally paying her respects.

257
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:44,264
That, or she's finally snapped.

258
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,066
Go ahead and assemble a team.

259
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,602
We're in closer proximity
to her here than Michael is.

260
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,870
She had a good run.

261
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:51,505
Won't be another one like her.

262
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:53,574
Don't be so sure.

263
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:01,456
Hello?

264
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,368
Well, don't just stand
there, Alex, try it on.

265
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,867
You'll find it fits perfectly.

266
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,969
I don't wear stuff like this.

267
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:19,333
As a style choice, or because
you're not used to it?

268
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,201
Because it's ugly.

269
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:23,303
And you're beautiful.

270
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:26,039
Michael was right
about that much.

271
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:29,732
So what?

272
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,801
You're the one that's
supposed to teach me

273
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,634
how to walk and talk,

274
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,200
chew with my mouth closed?

275
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:36,535
My name is Amanda,

276
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,266
and I'm the one who's
going to show you

277
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,168
how to embrace your beauty

278
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,601
and use it to your advantage.

279
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,502
Your journey begins right
here in this chair.

280
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:47,805
I'm not smearing that crap
on my face.

281
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:49,498
It's not like this
will be the first time

282
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,601
you've reinvented
yourself, Alex.

283
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,235
I'm very impressed wit your
accent, or lack thereof.

284
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,234
How?

285
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,503
Well, based on your age now,

286
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,199
and taking into account
the 5 years or so

287
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,001
you'd have to work
to lose your accent.

288
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,201
It wasn't hard to
answer the question

289
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,103
what kind of 14 year
old Ukrainian girl

290
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:18,032
purchases a forged identity?

291
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,334
Someone who was brought here

292
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,635
against her will, on a boat,

293
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,240
with many and the girls just like her.

294
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,505
Not like me.

295
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,401
I escaped.

296
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:32,804
Your captors, yes, but not
the junk they hooked you on.

297
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:34,736
You're a survivor, Alex.

298
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,535
You made it through hell,
you'll make it through this.

299
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,036
All I'm here to show you is you
don't have to be hard to survive.

300
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,503
Sometimes vulnerability
can be our greatest weapon.

301
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:53,812
Position is unchanged.
Use caution. She will be armed.

302
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:05,115
Bye, Niki.

303
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,292
Execute.

304
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,535
Target on the move!

305
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,067
Target on the move.

306
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,667
North gate, north gate!

307
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,568
Radio back when
you have visual.

308
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:35,938
Good boy, Birkhoff.

309
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,775
What are you gonna do?

310
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:42,044
You'll see.

311
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,435
Ahh.
Congratulations, Birkhoff.

312
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,300
You found me.

313
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,502
What is that?
Truth serum?

314
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,101
It's pain desensitizer.

315
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,904
I don't want you
passing out on me.

316
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,136
So, what, you gonna torture me?
Is that it?

317
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,053
Not if you tell me
what I need to know.

318
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,635
Well, I always told you
you were hot.

319
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,600
You know that.

320
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,001
I want access
to Division's network.

321
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:19,204
Log-ins, passwords.

322
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:22,833
Bitch, just skip to the part
where you kill me.

323
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,201
No.

324
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:26,998
Seriously, do it!

325
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,400
Because if I give you
those codes,

326
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,235
Percy will kill me.
Shut up!

327
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:47,630
What do you want with the network?

328
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,800
Finding where it was
you've been hiding out.

329
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,202
I'm not hiding anymore.

330
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:53,769
Then what are you doing?

331
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,372
You're not trying
to come at us, are you?

332
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,202
Man. Niki...

333
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:05,199
Niki, you're insane.

334
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,733
Don't call me Niki.

335
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,235
Then don't call me nerd.

336
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:10,266
Remember you used
to call me that?

337
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,108
"Patch me through
to Michael, nerd.

338
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:17,536
This computer's busted,
fix it, nerd."

339
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:19,836
Place ain't the same
without you, babe.

340
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:21,571
Then let's burn it down.

341
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:25,299
You seriously think you can burn
down Division all on your own?

342
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,733
Who says I'm on my own?

343
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,103
So you playing
for the other side now?

344
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:34,766
Well, if you got such big guns
on your side backing you up,

345
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,169
what do you need me for?

346
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,069
Well, because they may be able
to get me the intel I need.

347
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:43,199
But I know you can get it.

348
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,935
Well, then we're right back
where we started.

349
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:48,304
Just understand,

350
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:49,528
if you do this,

351
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:51,697
you're going to have
to kill your way through

352
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:53,199
a whole lot of people you know.

353
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,801
Starting with me.

354
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,635
Niki.

355
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:07,764
We've got Birkhoff.

356
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,567
The signal interference
is gone.

357
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:13,470
His tracking implant's
back online.

358
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,234
Let's hope it's still
inside him.

359
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,001
She's long gone, guys.

360
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:37,038
Good hustle, though.
Very nice.

361
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,602
Someone want
to get me off this?

362
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,604
Michael, a little help here?

363
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:58,931
Ah, look.

364
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:00,599
All cleaned up.

365
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,576
You know, they say Amanda

366
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:04,136
can pretty up a pig.

367
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:06,112
You should go see her sometime.

368
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:11,735
He's intense.

369
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,064
He's about to go on
his first op.

370
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,500
He's just stressed.

371
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:17,103
Heh. Even though
he won't admit it.

372
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,863
You guys...

373
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,065
Division doesn't allow
relationships.

374
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,368
Who said anything
about a relationship?

375
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,033
New girl's a spitfire, Thom.

376
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,000
Maybe you can get him
to give it up.

377
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,668
We want to know about
operation Black Arrow.

378
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,135
Look, I told you, that's...

379
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:38,037
That's classified? God.

380
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:40,065
You sound like one of them now.

381
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,670
Come on. I know it's going
down at the Wyckland hotel.

382
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:47,203
Who told you that?

383
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:50,140
This is a spy school, Thom.

384
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:53,143
I spied on you googling
stuff at the computer lab.

385
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:56,832
The Wyckland hotel,
some west African V.I.P.

386
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,703
General Sawani or
Sa-weenie or something.

387
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,434
You can get in trouble for that.

388
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,533
Please.

389
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,933
Who am I going to tell?

390
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:07,703
I'm just jealous
you get to smoke someone.

391
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,703
I mean, what are we
here for, right? What?

392
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,834
You disagree?

393
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,402
What are we here for?

394
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,034
Really?

395
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:20,436
Ah, man.

396
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,000
Is she playing with me?

397
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,168
At least half of our
missions are counter intel.

398
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:27,065
Deep cover infiltrations...

399
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,668
and the other half?

400
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,503
You're here to kill
for the man, honey.

401
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,653
They're going to teach you
to kill with a gun.

402
00:24:33,653 --> 00:24:36,031
They're going to teach you to kill
with your nails,

403
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:37,599
they're going to tell you
who to kill

404
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,701
and when to kill them.

405
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:41,503
And if you don't deliver,

406
00:24:41,537 --> 00:24:43,505
they're going to kill you.

407
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:47,062
Jaden, you're up.

408
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,601
She's running out of options.

409
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,567
Ah. I mean,
if she can't crack me,

410
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:56,569
there's no way she's going
to crack this place.

411
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:59,159
She say who was working for?

412
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,767
No.

413
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,869
Honestly, I think it's a bluff.

414
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,134
I think she's on her own.

415
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,634
I mean, you should have
seen her, she was a wreck.

416
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,701
I was able to turn
the tables on her easy.

417
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:09,403
Yeah, was that before or after

418
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:12,239
she duct-taped you to that
springy rocking horse?

419
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,301
The only reason
why you're alive

420
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:15,966
is because she wanted you that way.

421
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,167
We need to suspend
all operations

422
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:18,268
until we can contain this.

423
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:20,771
As long as she's out
there, she's a threat.

424
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:24,501
Threats are what we put down
using our resources.

425
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:26,614
Nikita is a complication.

426
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:27,402
If you believe Birkhoff.

427
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,101
I'm telling the truth, Michael.

428
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,605
And she didn't kill me
because she likes me.

429
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:36,326
Think you're just jealous
she didn't ask about you.

430
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,467
Where are you going?

431
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,486
Joint intelligence

432
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:40,000
fundraiser tonight.
I've gotta put in

433
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:41,345
an appearance.
For the record,

434
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:42,522
I'm not going to let a piece

435
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:44,238
of street trash
slow down this operation.

436
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:46,593
Not for one minute.
All operations are go,

437
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:49,115
including Black Arrow.

438
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:53,320
âª Ooh âª

439
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:57,794
âª ooh âª

440
00:25:57,862 --> 00:26:00,990
âª ooh âª

441
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:05,026
âª ooh âª

442
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:09,567
âª ooh âª

443
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,493
âª ooh âª

444
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:17,034
âª how, how did I do this?âª

445
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:20,869
âª me, I put the wall
around my heart âª

446
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:25,006
âª why didn't I notice âª

447
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,471
âª such a cold detachment
from the start? âª

448
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,104
âª without joy, joy,
joy in the rain âª

449
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:36,544
âª I could feel
forever the same âª

450
00:26:36,612 --> 00:26:38,562
âª ooh âª

451
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:50,497
The united
nations aims to end civil war

452
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,534
in a region plagued
by warring factions.

453
00:26:52,602 --> 00:26:55,837
He's going to eat.
One hour.

454
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,635
Get the car ready.

455
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,705
The car is ready.

456
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:05,641
Lobby's clear.
Take your time.

457
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,433
Hey!

458
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,534
This is my water.

459
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:16,902
Oh, I'm sorry.

460
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,167
I thought this was left here
by another guest.

461
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:19,502
Would you like a new one?

462
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,301
No.

463
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,467
Towel, sir?

464
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,101
Four is down.

465
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,467
Gardiah.

466
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,601
Gardiah, what's wrong?

467
00:28:20,804 --> 00:28:23,238
Gardiah, what's wrong?

468
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:27,998
Go check it out.

469
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,502
That should do it.

470
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:33,737
Phew.

471
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:36,406
I hope so.

472
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,437
That could have gone better.

473
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,599
Gardiah is out.

474
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,435
Gardiah's out, Gardiah's out.

475
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,801
No, show your...

476
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:15,596
General,

477
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:18,432
wake up. You're at
the united nations.

478
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,834
What are you doing?

479
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,500
You can't do this to me.

480
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,668
Do what, save your life?

481
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,239
I hope you noticed.

482
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,334
The kill squad
just tried to take you out

483
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,002
before you could make it to
your peace summit tomorrow.

484
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,266
You're an American.

485
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,767
I'm an ally of
the United States.

486
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,809
The United States
didn't attack you.

487
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:36,702
One of their weapons did;

488
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,816
A weapon they've
lost control of.

489
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,200
A unit called Division.

490
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,634
I don't understand.

491
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,801
It's simple.
Your country's rich with oil

492
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,300
but you don't own any of it.

493
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,901
The companies that drill it do.

494
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,434
They know they minute that
you stabilize your country,

495
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:50,903
the second you end civil war,

496
00:31:50,937 --> 00:31:52,504
you'll kick 'em out.

497
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:55,066
Those companies contracted
Division to kill you.

498
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,201
How do you know this?

499
00:31:57,235 --> 00:31:58,735
Who are you?

500
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,001
I'm someone who wants
to see Division fail.

501
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,801
Peace.

502
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:21,366
Well, hello, Alex.

503
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,568
It's good to see you again.

504
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:28,117
I was, um...

505
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,666
I was wondering
if you could help me.

506
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,135
Well, of course.
It's what I'm here for.

507
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,077
Tell me how I can help.

508
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,192
You can help me get out of here.
Alex... Shut up!

509
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,300
We're going to walk
to the elevator,

510
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,068
you're going to open it,
and I'm going to get in it.

511
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,667
And go where?

512
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,367
I didn't kill anyone.

513
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:50,999
But I swear to God,
if you don't get up right now,

514
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,699
I will kill you.

515
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,835
The elevator doesn't
lead to freedom.

516
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:56,869
Just another room.

517
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,168
What?

518
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,080
The more you try to get out,

519
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,385
the more you realize

520
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,302
there will always be
another room.

521
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,302
I don't know who told
you these things, Alex.

522
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,701
We're not murderers.

523
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:14,368
We're protectors.
We protect our home.

524
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:16,402
What home?

525
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:18,596
Home is wherever
you stop running.

526
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,118
You haven't been
home for so long,

527
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:21,319
you probably forget what
it even feels like.

528
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,221
Well, it begins...

529
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,736
It begins with a pro.

530
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,602
You promise
to put down the shears.

531
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,969
I promise to forget
this ever happened,

532
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,401
and we begin again.

533
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,668
Welcome home.

534
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,102
Glad you're able to be
here tonight, Percy.

535
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,232
Makes one of us.

536
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,834
John, what did you want
to tell me

537
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:08,302
that I couldn't hear
on the phone?

538
00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:11,538
The CIA has made
my committee aware

539
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,302
of some very high level
espionage activities.

540
00:34:14,403 --> 00:34:16,504
Kidnappings, assassinations.

541
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:19,307
It's clearly the work of a
skilled intelligence network.

542
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,641
But we can't attribute it

543
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,110
to any one of our enemies.

544
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:24,545
Or allies.

545
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:26,092
You come across
anything like that?

546
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:29,395
Not that I'm aware of.

547
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:33,099
Hey, you work for us,
remember that.

548
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,736
I work for whoever happens
to be sitting in your chair.

549
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:39,437
That person tends
to come and go.

550
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:44,965
Black Arrow was blown.

551
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,001
Nikita sabotaged the op.

552
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,733
Then what the hell are
you doing here find her!

553
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:50,199
We need to pull in
assets from the field.

554
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,800
We trained Nikita
to be a ghost.

555
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,234
Finding her when she
doesn't want to be found

556
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,601
is next to impossible.

557
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,803
Hey, guys.

558
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,900
I thought I heard my name.

559
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,069
How did you get in here?
Front door.

560
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,199
Like you.

561
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,201
Who are you bothering now?

562
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,135
What, I can't mingle?

563
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:20,032
She's been behaving
herself, senator.

564
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,500
I'm sorry, I didn't
get your name.

565
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,501
Oh. Nikita.

566
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:25,300
Beautiful.

567
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,833
Your daughter?

568
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,801
Family friend.

569
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:30,603
Yes. Shall...

570
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:32,158
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:34,180
We better get some
seltzer on that.

572
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,355
That's right, that's right.
This way, senator.

573
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,601
If you think senator Marcus

574
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:44,102
is going to be leverage,

575
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:45,865
he's not.

576
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,267
He was just my ticket tonight.

577
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,501
I found out what
escort service he used

578
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:51,603
and I worked it
so I was his date.

579
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:54,598
Well, you've been planning
this for a while, huh?

580
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,763
I want you to know
I can get to you,

581
00:35:57,763 --> 00:35:59,669
and hit you where
it hurts the most.

582
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:02,039
My feelings?
Your funding.

583
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,273
Tonight was just a taste.

584
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:06,667
I'm going to take you apart,
piece by piece,

585
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:09,337
mission by mission.

586
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,003
Didn't you accompany me
to one of these once?

587
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,971
Yes.

588
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,600
5 years ago.

589
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:21,399
You needed some arm candy
to distract some v.I.P.

590
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,998
I'm surprised
you remember that.

591
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,235
I remember everything.
Ah.

592
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,701
Which is why I decided to bring
along a little back-up tonight.

593
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,069
And I'm afraid I'm going to
have to decline your offer.

594
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,469
You know this doesn't
have to be awkward.

595
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:44,855
Just take my arm and we'll
go right out that door.

596
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:48,804
We can do it quiet,
or the other way.

597
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,100
Your choice.

598
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:52,352
No, Percy, it's yours.

599
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,878
And you just made it.

600
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,502
Ah, stay here.

601
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,867
Nikita!

602
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,767
Safety on.

603
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,901
Toss it behind you,
don't turn around.

604
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:46,833
Get down on the ground.

605
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,701
Slowly.

606
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,001
Spread your arms and your legs.

607
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,601
Just like old times, huh?

608
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,268
Shut up.

609
00:37:55,302 --> 00:37:57,069
You were free.

610
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,366
You had gotten out,
you were gone.

611
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,968
What the hell
are you doing back here?

612
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,867
Someone has to stop Percy.

613
00:38:02,902 --> 00:38:04,669
If Percy goes down,
he has no problem

614
00:38:04,703 --> 00:38:06,070
taking everybody down with him.

615
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:07,764
This country will not recover.

616
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:09,065
Do you want that?

617
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,867
What are you talking about?

618
00:38:10,968 --> 00:38:14,070
I'm talking about evidence
of every job Division has had,

619
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,001
locked away in encrypted files,

620
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:18,069
hidden all over the world.

621
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,931
So he gets a free pass?

622
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,699
Keep training slaves
to kill for him?

623
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,534
Spare me, Nikita.

624
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,436
I know you're in this
for revenge.

625
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,405
You blame me?

626
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:30,166
You know firsthand
what it feels like.

627
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,768
Have the thing you love most
in life taken away from you.

628
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,848
It wasn't your life.
It was your cover.

629
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,693
I warned you not to get
emotionally attached.

630
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:42,839
You mean the way you did...

631
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,901
With me?

632
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,335
Don't. Don't.

633
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,235
Michael, I know why
you're staying there.

634
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,433
You want to protect
the other recruits

635
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,100
the way you protected me.

636
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,435
I can't protect you anymore.

637
00:38:58,698 --> 00:39:00,599
Then let me go.

638
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,300
Or stop me now.

639
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,534
I'll give you a head start.

640
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,568
If we meet again I can't
promise what will happen.

641
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,101
I can.

642
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,202
It's a good wound.
They'll think you tried to stop me.

643
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,934
Just trying to protect you.

644
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,936
Nikita is our new
priority target.

645
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,705
Threat level 6.

646
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:45,708
Every operative engaged
at that level or lower

647
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:48,264
will be working on this
full time.

648
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,165
Mike will be heading
the detail.

649
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,003
Amanda will be directing
our overseas assets.

650
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:56,266
There's really only
a handful of organizations

651
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,267
who could intercept
our intelligence.

652
00:39:57,368 --> 00:39:58,501
Someone is running her,

653
00:39:58,535 --> 00:39:59,635
and I want to know who.

654
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,534
Bring me her head

655
00:40:01,602 --> 00:40:03,503
and bring me all of theirs.

656
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:05,332
This is war!

657
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,834
Now get to work.

658
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:04,858
I'm never gonna get this.

659
00:41:04,892 --> 00:41:08,695
Yeah, someone else
told me that once.

660
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,568
She was wrong, too.

661
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:17,614
Remember, you're just
getting started.

662
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:25,485
Damn right.

663
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,601
Here we go.
